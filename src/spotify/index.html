            <h3>Project:</h3>
            
            <p class="body-text">Spotify Match is an interactive campaign concept, based on a simple insight: People love discussing music. We took this insight and turned it into the campaign: <em>«Spotify Match – Discover music that you’ll love. Together.»</em></p>

            <p class="body-text">The reason why we built this campaign is very simple. We wanted to grow the Spotify brand to more than just delivering music to the entire world. We wanted Spotify to be a platform for sparking conversation about music. A place where people can connect with one another. </p>

            <p class="body-text">The outcome was an in app advertising campaign that prompts users with similar taste to connect through Spotify Match, based on existing data that Spotify gathers about their users.</p>

          <h3>Role &amp; Impact:</h3>
          <h4>Conceptualization, User Interface Design</h4>

          <p class="body-text">During this project I took on the role of Project Lead and Art Direction. I literally had my fingers in every piece of the project, from user research and interface design, to business planning and presentation. I lead the team from start to finish with one singular purpose; to make Lava amazing, together with amazing people. I made sure everything was on track for every deadline, and I quality assured every single piece of work we presented to the client.</p>
