          <h1 class="text-center first">Hey!</h1>

          <p>My name is Øyvind Nordbø, and I’m a Product Designer from Norway. Or a developer. Or Project Manager. You know what? You can call me whatever you want. Call me a slob if you feel like it. I don’t really care. If you really want to flatter me, call me a talented generalist.</p>

          <p>I love exploring new stuff. Ever since I dug up Photoshop from my dads half-busted laptop when I was a little kid, I’ve always found technology and beauty in combination to be very fascinating.</p>

          <p>I don’t really subscribe to specific labeling when it comes to design, because design is so damn fluffy that one never really seems to find a coherent definition. I believe in lifelong learning, where every new challenge is a new opportunity to explore something new within the industry.</p>

          <p>Other than that, I love spending time staring at a half full wine glass, pretending like I know something about it. I could go on forever about myself, but if you’re really interested in me. Why don’t you reach out? I’m all over the internet.</p>

          <p>Google for my name or “onordbo” to find me everywhere else.</p>
